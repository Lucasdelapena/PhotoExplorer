Use this to run the code:
python Assignment2_CS4420.py -a -g -rows numrows -cols numcols -t type indir outdir


This program is built off python 3 and is needed to run. You will also need to install opencv-python, and screeninfo. With this project my biggest issue was tyring to get the aspect ratio to work and it was such a simple fix, I forgot to resize the window size and it's fixed now but I spent a lot of time trying to get this to work.

Sample execution:
python Assignment2_CS4420.py -a -g -rows 480 -cols 640 -t jpg dir outdir

installs:
pip install screen info
pip install opencv-python
