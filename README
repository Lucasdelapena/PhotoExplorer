Use this to run the code:
python Assignment2_CS4420.py -a -g -rows numrows -cols numcols -t type indir outdir


This program is built off python 3 and is needed to run. You will also need to install opencv-python, and screeninfo.with this project I just didn't have a lot of time to spend on it so it wasn't as perfected as I wanted it to be. Doing this project it seems easier than it is which is upsetting because I've should've spent more time on it.

Sample execution:
python Assignment2_CS4420.py -a -g -rows 480 -cols 640 -t jpg dir outdir

installs:
pip install screen info
pip install opencv-python
